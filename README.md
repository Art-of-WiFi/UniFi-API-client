## UniFi Controller API client class

## Requirements

- a web server with PHP and cURL modules installed (tested on apache2 with PHP Version 5.6.1 and cURL 7.42.1)
- network connectivity between this web server and the server and port (normally TCP port 8443) where the UniFi Controller is running

## Installation ##

You can use [Composer](#composer), [Git](#git) or simply [Download the Release](#download-the-release) to install the API client class.

### Composer

The preferred method is via [composer](https://getcomposer.org). Follow the [installation instructions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) if you do not already have composer installed.

Once composer is installed, simply execute this command from the shell in your project directory:

```sh
composer require art-of-wifi/unifi-api-client
```

 Or you can manually add the package to your composer.json file:

```javascript
{
    "require": {
        "art-of-wifi/unifi-api-client": "^1.1"
    }
}
```

Finally, be sure to include the autoloader in your code:

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
```

### Git

Execute the following `git` command from the shell in your project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Art-of-WiFi/UniFi-API-client.git
```

When git is done cloning, include the file containing the class like so in your code:

```php
require_once('path/to/src/Client.php');
```

### Download the Release

If you prefer not to use composer or git, you can simply [download the package](https://github.com/Art-of-WiFi/UniFi-API-client/archive/master.zip), uncompress the zip file, then include the file containing the class in your code like so:

```php
require_once('path/to/src/Client.php');
```

## Example usage

A basic example how to use the class:

```php
/**
 * load the class using the composer autoloader
 */
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

/**
 * initialize the Unifi API connection class, log in to the controller and request the alarms collection
 * (this example assumes you have already assigned the correct values to the variables used)
 */
$unifi_connection = new UniFi_API\Client($controller_user, $controller_password, $controller_url, $site_id, $controller_version, true);
$login            = $unifi_connection->login();
$results          = $unifi_connection->list_alarms(); // returns a PHP array containing alarm objects
```

Please refer to the `examples/` directory for some more detailed examples which you can use as a starting point for your own PHP code.

#### IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. The last parameter (`true`) that is passed to the constructor, enables validation of the controller's SSL certificate which is otherwise **disabled** by default. It is highly recommended to enable this feature in production environments where you have a valid SSL cert installed on the UniFi Controller, and which is associated with the FQDN of the server as used in the `controller_url` parameter. This option was added with API client version 1.1.16.

2. In the example above, `$site_id` is the 8 character short site "name" which is visible in the URL when managing the site in the UniFi Controller:

   `https://<controller IP address or FQDN>:8443/manage/site/jl3z2shm/dashboard`

   In this case, `jl3z2shm` is the value required for $site_id.

## Need help or have suggestions?

There is still work to be done to add functionality and improve the usability of this class, so all suggestions/comments are welcome.
